It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s, replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre (1,300 ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the city extend to the south of the rock. Zuma Rock, a 792-metre (2,598 ft) monolith, lies just north of the city on the expressway to Kaduna.\n\n  \n  At the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 776,298 making it one of the ten most populous cities in Nigeria. According to the United Nations, Abuja grew by 139.7% between 2000 and 2010, making it the fastest growing city in the world. As of 2015, the city is experiencing an annual growth of at least 35%, retaining its position as the fastest-growing city on the African continent and one of the fastest-growing in the world. As at 2016, the metropolitan area of Abuja is estimated at six million persons, placing it behind only Lagos, as the most populous metro area in Nigeria.\n\n  \n  The diversity of the cuisine available is reflective of the social and economic diversity of Abuja. Roadside vendors, tea stalls, South Indian, North Indian, Muslim food, Chinese and Western fast food are all very popular in the city. Abuja can also be called a foodie's paradise because of its vast variety of foods and edibles with a touch of Abuja's uniqueness and tradition\n\n## Problem description :\nSuppose i travel and keep changing places very frequently. This is very hectic and plus i get to experience very different types of environment, of which i donot have much knowledge about. In such situation, food can be an important factor for decided how you rate your trips and plus also recommmending it to the people. Food can also attract people around to world to try it out if it were to be the best. In such scenarios, we need to find the right place, at reasonable cost, to serve us the best possible way. So there are few questions that must be addresed, such as :\n\n1. How many types of foods are available in the restaurant ?\n2. which is the most nearest to me with good rating ?\n3. How many \"similar\" restaurants are available near by me ?\n4. Do the \"similar\" restaurants cost more ? if so, what speciality do that have ?\n  \n  To address such question, XXYZ company's manager decides to allocate this project to me not just to find out solutions to the questions but also build a system that can help in recommending new places based on their rankings compared to the previously visited by me.\n\n  \n  Expectations from this recommender system is to get answer for the questions, and in such a way that it uncovers all the perspective of managing recommendations. It is sighted to show :\n\n1. What types of restaurants are present in a particular area ?\n2. where are the similar restaurant present based on a preference to particular food ?\n3. How do different restaurants rank with respect to my preferences ?\n\n## Target audience :\nTarget audiences for this project does not limit to a person who keeps travelling but everyone. People could simply decide to look for a similar restaurant all the time because they are addicted to a specific category of food. People who rarely use restaurants would prefer to have the most rated restaurants nearby them and all this could be easily handed by our recommender system. So target for this project is basically everyone who is exploring different places or similar places.\n\n## Success rate :\nWith restaurants evolving, new food categories emerge, hybrid food starts to be more popular, we need a system that could help us access vast number of food varieties. It is impossible for a person to ask each and everyone about their visit to a particular place and also not everyone remembers everything. On the other hand, Computers are good at remembering things, and with Machine learning to its peak, it high time technology will by our personal guidence and help us personally based on our likes and dislikes. So people would care about this project as their personal assistance and success rate could certainly increase with time.\n"

            "source": "# Data Requirement \nTo find a solution to the questions and build a recommender model, we need data and lots of data. Data can answer question which are unimaginable and non answerable by humans because humans do not have the tendency to analyse such large dataset and produce analtics to find a solutions.\n\n  \n  Let's consider the base scenario :\n\n  \n  Suppose i want to find a restaurant, then logically, i need 3 things :\n\n1. Its geographical coordinates(latitide and longitude) to find our where exactly it is located.\n2. Population of the neighborhood where the restaurant is located.\n3. Average income of neighborhood to know how much is the restaurant worth.\n  \n  Lets take a closer look at each of these :\n\n1. To access location of a restaurant, its Latitude and Longitude is to be known so that we can point at its coordinates and create a map displaying all the restaurants with its labels respectively.\n2. Population of a neighborhood is very important factor in determining a restaurant's growth and amount of customers who turn up to eat. Logically, the more the population of a neighborhood, the more people will be interested to walk openly into a restaurant and less the population, less number of people frequently visit a restaurant. Also if more people visit, better the restaurant is rated because it is accessed by different people with different taste. Hence is is very important factor.\n3. Income of a neighborhood is also very important factor as population was. Income is directly proportional to richness of a neighborhood. If people in a neighborhood earns more than an average income, then it is very much possible that they will spend more however not always true with very less probability. So an restaurant accessment is proportional to income of a neighborhood.\n# Data collection :\nCollecting geographical coordinates is not difficult but after googling for more than 2 days, it was not available on open source data websites such as wikipedia, india gov website, census report websites etc. So i decided to use Google maps API to fetch latitude and longitude but google API has limited number of calls that i could make with my free account. So it would take around 15 - 20 days to fetch location of all the neighborhoods in bangalore. Initially i scrapped list of neighbor's using beautifulSoup4 from wikipedia. The table headings becoming the boroughs and data becoming the neighborhoods. Bangalore has 8 boroghs and 64 neighborhoods. So i manually googled each neighborhood to find its corresponding latitude and longitude. After doing so, i produced the following dataframme.\n\n\nPopulation by neighborhood is again easy to find out given that its readily available. But incase of bangalore, it is again not the case. i was able to find population data for few cities. Here is the link. Rest other neighborhood population is assumed and may be inaccurate but since this is a demonstrating project, the main idea to get the working model. The dataframe for bangalore neighborhood population looks like :\nIncome by neighborhood is again easy to find out given that its readily available. But incase of bangalore, it is again not the case. i was able to find Income data for main city. Here is the link. Neighborhood Income is assumed and may be inaccurate but since this is a demonstrating project, the main idea to get the working model. The dataframe for bangalore neighborhood population looks like :\nFourSquare API :\nUse of foursquare is focused to fetch nearest venue locations so that we can use them to form a cluster. Foursquare api leverages the power of finding nearest venues in a radius(in my case : 500mts) and also corresponding coordinates,venue location and names. After calling, the following dataframe is created:"
